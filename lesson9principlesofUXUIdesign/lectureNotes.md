# Principles of UX/UI Design

## What is UX/UI Design?

- UX/UI Design is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.

Jacob Nielsen's 5 usability quality components:

1. Learnability

- how easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

2. Efficiency

- once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

3. Memorability

- when users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

4. Errors

- how many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

5. Satisfaction

- how pleasant is it to use the design?

### Empathy tools: Artifacts in the UX process

- User Persona
  A user persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. It is a tool that helps designers to empathize with the users and understand their needs, behaviors, and goals.

- Conducting Customer Interviews

Interview at least 5 people. After conducting several interviews, you'll notice that you're getting very little or no new information. This is a good sign that you've reached saturation point and can stop interviewing.

- Making Assumptions

If you've been working on a project for quite some time you may have enough information to make reasonably accurate assumptions about your customers. Just make sure to back them up with research.

- Using Web Analytics

Web analytics tools are excellent resource for quantitative data. They can tell you how your customers behave but not why. You'll still need to talk to them to find out what motivates them.

- Creating A Customer Persona Group

Once you've gathered all the information you need, you can start creating customer persona groups. These groups will help you understand your customers better and make better decisions when designing your product.

![User Persona Sample](UserPersonaSample.png)

First, add a header to your persona; this includes a fictional name, an image, a demographic profile and a quote that summarizes what matters most to your persona. These features ensure your persona is memorable and helps the design team focus on whom they're designing for. Add a personal background, a mini-biography of sorts. Then you create a psychological profile such as the user's needs, interests, motivations, and pain points.

This allows you to understand better why your user behaves in a certain way, including why they need or want to use your product. For Tilly, in the above example, it would be for expediency. When creating user personas, remember to focus on the context of the product you're designing while you want to build up a realistic character. There's no need to include pointless details that won't influence the final design.

User stories
A user story is a brief statement or abstract that describes the user and their need or goal. It establishes who the user is, what they require, and why they require it. Each user persona typically has one user story. User stories usually adhere to a straightforward template:

```markdown
    As a (type of user), I want (a goal) for (some reason).
```

- Type of user: This is the end-user or the user's role in the application software. For example: "As an online banking customer."

- A goal: This is the action taken by the user on the application software. For example: "I want to add a payee to my account."

- Some reason: - The outcome or desired value the user expects from the action performed. For example: "so that I can transfer money to the payee."

> In this example, the user story is:
>
> "As an online banking customer, I want to add a payee to my account, so I can transfer money to the payee."

User stories assist in documenting helpful information about users, such as the various needs and motivations for using a website or app. They also help the development team estimate the timeline required to deliver the final product.

- Scenarios

A scenario is a situation that depicts how users interact with your website or app. Scenarios describe the user's motivations for being there (their task or goal) and a question they need to be answered. They also suggest possible ways to achieve these goals. Scenarios are essentially an extension of the user story and can be applied to various target users. However, they can also be divided into use cases, which describe the sequence of tasks that any given user performs in a provided functionality or path.

For example, a scenario could describe how the user transfers money to a payee using a mobile device on his way to work. Scenarios help stakeholders visualize the design team's ideas by providing context for the intended user experience â€” frequently bridging communication gaps between creative and business thinking. Scenarios aid the design team in imagining the ideal solution to a user's problem.

Scenario mapping is the first step in scenario planning. The design team, developers, and product owners gather to discuss ideas and design a plan centered on their user personas. They think about the critical task that the user hopes to achieve after defining the primary user through persona development. The following step is to conduct a scenario analysis, contextualize the user's goals and walk through the steps the user would take.

- Storyboards

Storyboards are a series of illustrations that depict the user's journey through a website or app. They are a visual representation of the user's experience and help the design team understand the user's needs and motivations. Storyboards are a great way to communicate ideas and concepts to stakeholders and team members. They can also help identify potential problems and solutions early in the design process.

![Storyboard Sample](Storyboards.png)

- **How to create a storyboard**

To create a storyboard, set the scene by defining:

- your persona,

- the environment (where the persona is) and

- the plot (what they want to achieve).

Then you begin to sketch out the basic idea for each scene and build it up with as many interactions as you want.

### 5 stages of UX process

- Empathize - Understand the user's needs and motivations.
- Define - Define the problem you're trying to solve.
- Ideate - Generate ideas to solve the problem.
- Prototype - Create a prototype of your solution.
- Test - Test your solution with real users.

- Customer Journey Maps

A customer journey map is a visual representation of the customer's experience with your product or service. It shows the steps a customer takes to achieve a goal and the emotions they experience along the way. Customer journey maps help you understand your customer's needs and pain points, so you can design a better user experience.

![Customer Journey Map Sample](CustomerJourneyMap.png)

- User Research Tools

1. User Persona
   User personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use your product or service. They help you understand your users' needs, behaviors, and goals.

2. Empathy Maps
   Empathy maps are visual representations of what your users think, feel, see, and do. They help you understand your users' emotions and motivations.
   Divided into four quadrants: Say, Think, Do, and Feel.

3. Scenarios
   Scenarios are stories that describe how users interact with your product or service. They help you understand your users' goals and motivations.

# Evaluation cheat sheets

## Dieter Ram's 10 Principles of Good Design

1. Good design is innovative
   Whether you are making a change or doing something in a new way, developing new ideas or making improvements to existing designs and working alongside new technology, all of these offer a multitude of opportunities for you to be innovative within a design.

2. Good design makes a product useful
   It doesn't matter how stunning a product looks if it is practically unusable as it becomes completely worthless. Products are not pieces of art to be admired. They are there to serve a purpose and solve a problem.

3. Good design is aesthetic
   Beautiful items tend to make us feel comfortable. If a product is beautiful, you may be more inclined to use and want it. Some may argue against this point as you may have your own subjective idea of what is beautiful, and some well-designed items do prioritize utility over beauty. Regardless of your taste, you may like the things around you to be beautiful irrespective of how you define beauty.

4. Good design makes a product understandable
   For example, handles on doors that don't indicate if they should be pushed or pulled or taps that don't indicate if they are hot or cold just leave the user confused. The opposite of this is an instantly understandable product that is completely self-explanatory and communicates what it's about, what it's for and how to use it. This saves a user from breaking the product or spending time reading through instruction manuals.

5. Good design is unobtrusive
   An obtrusive product is an over-designed product. Products that tend to fail are those created with the designer in mind or with presumptions of who the user might be and or how they might use it. The very best products allow the user to do exactly what they want to do. These products should also help the user to complete their intended tasks effectively and happily. The design should not hinder the individual's intuitive process.

6. Good design is honest
   Good design doesn't have tricks! It doesn't pretend to be something that it isn't, and it doesn't try to manipulate you into buying it by making promises that can't be kept. It should always have the user's best interests in mind, so it shouldn't have to try to lie to you or try to be something that it isn't.

7. Good design is long-lasting
   Design should always be thorough to the last detail and avoids being fashionable which means that it never appears old or antiquated.

8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
   A Good design should be detail-oriented and leave nothing to chance. Every single aspect of the design should be considered, and all the elements should qualify to be a part of that design. Products should be designed with care, thoroughness, and concern for the intended user.

9. Good design is environmentally friendly
   Pollution can arise from wasted resources throughout a product's lifespan. Design shouldn't be wasteful and should save resources where it can, both physically and digitally.

10. Good design is as little as possible
    Design should always be intentional. Anything that doesn't serve a purpose for the user should be excluded. With less clutter, a design will achieve more clarity for the user.

## Jakob Nielsen's Heuristics: 10 Usability Principles to Improve UI Design

1. Visibility of system status
   Explore your smartphone. Right after the screen lights up, it informs you about its battery and if you have a Wi-Fi connection, any received messages, missed calls and much more. Imagine how insecure you would feel if this information were missing. The system communicates its status and assists users in making better, more informed decisions by using signs, icons and indicators.

2. Match between the system and the real world
   Users may make assumptions about how a system will work based on their previous experiences with similar systems. You can help them overcome their initial discomfort by using language they are familiar with.

3. User control and freedom
   Digital spaces, like physical spaces, require quick 'emergency exits'. Users frequently select system functions by accident and need a clearly marked way to leave the unwanted position without going through an extended dialogue. So, support the undo and redo functions.

4. Consistency and standards
   Consistency is the key. A 'submit' button on one page should look the same across the site on any page. If you show information in a particular format on one page, it should look the same on all pages.

5. Error prevention
   A careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place is even better than good error messages. Remove conditions that may cause errors in your design, or look for them and give your users a confirmation option so that they can make an informed decision before tapping or selecting anything.

6. Recognition rather than recall
   Allow your users to recognize information in the user interface rather than expecting them to remember or recall it. Simply put, don't make your users work any harder than necessary! Make your navigation as clear, detailed and straightforward as possible. Offer them hints, remind them when something time-sensitive needs to be done and notify them when a screen or a process has been changed.

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
   Simply put, your system must be designed so that both experienced and inexperienced users can use it. Think of designing a system where a new user can find a way to perform a task without knowing any shortcuts. However, also design your system in such a way that an experienced user can use shortcuts to complete the action quickly and efficiently.

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design
   Make a fantastic first impression! Users notice aesthetics or how visually appealing your system is in the first 50 milliseconds of landing on a page, which is ten times faster than it takes them to read it. This means that you should make sure that you establish and reinforce your system's brand identity and credibility.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
   A good error message should be polite, easy to understand, precise, constructive, clearly visible, and take as little time as possible to fix the problem as well as educate your users.

10. Help and documentation
    Even though it is preferable that your system can be used without documentation. It is important that any such information should be: easy to find, focused on the user's task, include the actual steps they should take, and not be too large.

## Ben Shneidermann's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design

1. Strive for consistency
   Consistency is critical to maintaining uniformity throughout the site, whether it's the layout, the size of the button, the color code, or the tone used when writing the page. Consistency will enable you to establish your identity and stop users from abandoning your site.

2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
   Think about allowing your users to access all areas of your website with a few clicks. To accomplish this, you should create a good hierarchy in the menu and make things clear. Consider including features for both advanced and novice users, such as keyboard shortcuts or macro-capabilities.

3. Offer informative feedback
   If your users have completed or are completing activities on your website, it is best to provide feedback as soon as possible so that they can understand where they are in the system.

4. Design dialog to yield closure
   All interactions must have a beginning, middle and end. Once a task is completed, maybe give your users some peace of mind by providing them with informative feedback and well-defined choices for the next step, if applicable. Don't keep them guessing!

5. Offer simple error handling
   An interface should be designed to eliminate as many errors as possible. If something goes wrong, the system should make it simple for users to understand and resolve the problem. A good idea is to display clear error notifications and descriptive hints to resolve the problem. These are examples of simple ways to deal with system errors.

6. Permit easy reversal of actions
   Finding that there is an "undo" option after making a mistake is a huge relief. Your users should feel less anxious and more likely to explore options if they know there is a simple way to undo any mistakes. This rule applies to any action, sequence of steps or data entry in your system. This can range from a single button to a complete set of actions.

7. Support internal locus of control
   It is essential to give your users control and freedom so that they feel in control of the system instead of the other way around. As the designer, try to avoid surprises, interruptions and anything that the users didn't request. Users should be the ones who initiate actions.

8. Reduce short-term memory load
   As users, our attention span may be limited, so anything you can do to make your users' jobs easier is a win-win situation. Your users may prefer to recognize information rather than recall it. Try to keep interfaces simple and consistent and keep to patterns, standards and conventions. This may contribute to better recognition and ease of use. Depending on your users' objectives, you can add various features to help them. In an e-commerce setting, for example, a list of recently viewed or purchased items can be presented.

## Form design best practices and guidelines

- **Keep forms simple and straightforward**

Avoid adding any unnecessary fields or questions. Include only the required information in your form.

- **Use one column**

When possible, use a single-column web form layout â€” this is especially important when creating long multi-step forms. Single-column layouts are more straightforward for visitors to follow, understand, complete and submit than forms with multiple columns.

- **Clearly label your form**

Give your form a title that lets your visitors know what will happen once they submit it. For example, a simple form title like 'create an account' clearly states that once a visitor submits their information, they will have created an account.

- **Sort your form fields from the simplest to the most difficult**

Begin your form with the most straightforward field questions (such as name and email) before moving on to the more time-consuming questions, for example, billing and shipping information. When visitors start filling out your form and think, 'OK, I can quickly add my name and email,' they are far less likely to leave the page since they have already decided to commit.

- **Make use of inline form field validation**

Inline form validation is a procedure that checks a visitor's information in real-time as they fill out the form. Suppose your visitors enter incorrect information into a field, such as an incorrect credit card number or email. An error message will show below or inside the form field, alerting the visitor to their mistake and allowing them to quickly correct it and move on to the next question.

- **The text should be aligned to the left**

Align all your text â€“ including queries and labels - to the left side of the form so that it is easy for your visitors to read and complete. Researchers at the University of Basel observed that aligning text on the left side, above the form field box, decreases the time required to fill out the form. This alignment reduces the time a user's eyes have to move around, making the form easier to read.

- **Do not request phone numbers**

Unless collecting your visitors' phone numbers is critical, for example, a quote request or product demo, don't include it in your form. Asking for your visitors' phone numbers can create a feeling of suspicion unless they know a legitimate reason for the request. When possible, request an email address instead and use that to contact your visitors with their permission. Alternatively, make the phone number field in your form voluntary.

- **Use browser auto-fill**

Completing specific form fields is now quicker than ever, thanks to autofill features in browsers that draw from prior data entered from a visitor's device, like their first and last name. To help your visitors speed up the completion process, it's best practice to title each field with a word that browsers will recognize.

- **Create mobile-friendly forms**

Many people browse, purchase products and complete forms on their mobile devices, which is why mobile-friendly form design is critical. This helps visitors to your website to easily view a site on any mobile device and ensures that all the form information fits the screen size.

- **Error messages should be positive**

Make sure to sound positive when creating web form error messages. This is a great way to ensure that only correct information is submitted. Never blame the user; instead, use clear and concise language and include information that guides the visitor to the error. This way, they know precisely where it is and how it needs to be corrected.

- **Include smart defaults**

Enabling smart defaults is another excellent way to help speed up the form completion process while maintaining accuracy. Smart defaults use information like your user's current location to instantly enter details like city or town, saving them time.

- **For long forms, add progress bars**

Have you ever filled out a long form or survey and thought, "How many other questions are there?" Progress bars show how many questions your visitors must answer. They will give them a clue of how long it will take them to finish the task and may act as a form of motivation to finish the task at hand. These are especially helpful on long, multi-step forms.

- **Use reCAPTCHAs rather than CAPTCHAs**

Have you ever been asked to look at a relatively challenging image with numbers and letters and then to type those numbers and letters into a form field to confirm you're "not a robot" after completing a form? CAPTCHAs are used to identify SPAM and bots. They can, however, be time-consuming and frustrating to finish. They are still helpful; you may want to include this additional security measure in your forms. If this is the case, you should use reCAPTCHAs in your forms instead. reCAPTCHAs identify fake accounts and bots not only successfully but also require that a visitor checks only a box before submitting a form. A CAPTCHA uses lettering for security whereas a ReCAPTCHA asks the user to identify elements of images.

- **Allow users to navigate to the following form field by tab**

There's no reason your form shouldn't support keyboard shortcuts, as there are many available. A good practice is to allow visitors to use the tab key on their keyboard to move to the following form field on your forms without having to take their hands off their keyboards.

## How typography can be used to improve user experience

Because Typography contains so many elements, many designers overlook this discipline because mastering it takes time and practice. Remember that good typography is format-specific, and usability equals legibility. Let's go over a few key steps to ensure your next UI has legible typography that conveys the appropriate mood for your text.

- **Hierarchy**
  The size of a text has a significant impact on the user's reading experience. Hierarchical elements should be used to separate the blocks and improve communication. The titles or headers, subtitles, and body text comprise a basic typography hierarchy. Because headings are at the top of the typographic hierarchy, they are larger and heavier.

Remember to start with a font size that is comfortable for your body text. As a general rule of thumb:

- For desktops, use a font size of 16 points or higher for body text

- For iOS devices, use a text size of at least 11 point

- For Android devices, use at least 14 points for the main text

Because different sizes of body text are common, choose typefaces that work well in different sizes.

- **Text colors**
  Color selection is also essential. Colors are associated with various emotions as well as a visual hierarchy. As a result, it is a good idea to use different colors for titles, body text, links, buttons and error messages. Also, remember that the text color must contrast with the background color; this is critical for a good reading experience, and even though it may seem obvious, there still are a lot of non-legible buttons out there.

- **Line length**
  Take note of the length of the text lines. Set a length limit so that it isn't too long and interferes with the reading experience. To determine the best line length for a text, use a simple formula based on font size: multiply it by 30. So, if your font size is 10px, the ideal reading line length is 300px.

- **Avoid text walls**
  You should avoid creating a "wall of text." A wall of text, also known as a gray wall effect, is a single block of text that is devoid of any white space or other design elements. By inserting paragraph breaks at appropriate intervals, you can avoid the gray wall effect. You can also use the following design elements: images, quotations, headings and subheadings and bullet points. When working with long paragraphs, try to include anything that isn't text and breaks up the solid block.

## **Grid systems**

Grid systems are an essential tool in web design for creating visually appealing and organized layouts. They provide a framework for arranging elements on a page, ensuring consistency and alignment. By using a grid system, you can easily create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

# Usability test cheat sheet and template

## Usability testing

Usability testing is an evaluative user research technique that allows key stakeholders and the project team to understand better how people interact with a product. Usability testing can be done during the design, development, or after the product has been released. During a usability test, participants are required to perform specific tasks with the product and provide feedback.

Usability testing research methods can be conducted remotely or in person. The types are as follows:

- User interviews

- Unmoderated usability testing

### User interviews

It is critical to ask the right questions during a User Interview. You get what you ask for, as the saying goes! Because the researcher's time during an interview is limited and there is usually so much to cover, asking all possible questions is not an option. So, knowing which questions to ask and which to avoid is just as important as knowing how to ask them.

#### Prior to the User Interview

This is the stage when all of the research preparations are made. The following deliverables are produced as part of this phase:

Discussion Guide - research questions are prepared here, though what you write may not always be what you ask during interviews.

Interview Schedule

Roles and responsibilities, for example, notetakers, moderators, translators, and so on.

Scenarios List

A list of test materials, if any, are required, such as design prototypes, competition websites, and so on.

Reliance on stakeholders

Forms of consent and disclosure, etc.

Exit survey, which is mostly closed-ended questions

#### During the User Interview cycle

Whether the interviews are for exploratory or evaluative research, the ability to ask the right questions is crucial here. Let's explore some examples of how to run an effective interview.

##### Different types of questions

i) Warm-up question â€“it is important to get the participant talking and comfortable. For example, you can start by asking, "Do you prefer coffee or tea?"

ii) Begin the investigation with open questions.

- Explain your experience

- How many/how much...

- What is the cause of...

- When was the last time you...

- How do you...

iii) Task-based questions

- Show us how you do it...

- What motivates you to do that...

- What preparations do you need to make...

iv) Recall a previous experience

- Could you please share your most recent experience with...

- Tell me everything you remember about the last time you used...

- What was the most noteworthy aspect of...

- Consider a real-life situation in which this could have been useful...

v) Beliefs and attitudes

- What are your thoughts on...

- What do you enjoy the most about...

- What do you despise the most...

- In what way could this be useful...

- If you were to consider the advantages of... what would they be...

- What are your thoughts on...

vi) Inquiry questions

- Please tell me more about that.

- Could you please elaborate?

- Why did you go about it that way...

- Why did you think that...

- Let me repeat what you said. Is this what you meant?

- What makes you think that...

- If you think about it again...

vii) Closing remarks

- Do you have any questions you'd like to ask...

- Is there anything else you'd like to say?

#### After the User Interview

After you conduct user interviews, it is time to review the data you collected to use it in your design. Debriefing and topline summary are important items in this step.

##### Debriefing

Debriefing aids in determining what went well during the session. What can be improved, prioritized and so on.

##### Preparation and distribution of topline summary

This keeps stakeholders up to date on current findings and aids in making initial project and product decisions.

##### Updating the Research Schedule

This step deals with dropouts, changes in participant availability and so on. Stakeholders will always have questions that will be triggered during the interview. As a result, a researcher acting as a moderator should be on the lookout for those questions and try to incorporate them into the interview if time allows. Try to be as broad as possible with open questions. And remember that there is always more than you can say.

#### Unmoderated Usability Testing Types

With regard to its relationship to usability testing, the term "unmoderated" refers to research participants using the product when no one is watching or interacting with them. Unmoderated usability testing can be done in two ways:

##### Unmoderated in-person usability testing

The product is used by the participants at a predetermined physical location. No one is watching the participants while they use the product. After the user session is finished, the researcher may record and investigate the interaction and any comments made during the product usage. This method of usability testing is less popular than remote unmoderated usability testing because it requires the presence of researchers and participants at a fixed time and location.

##### Unmoderated remote usability testing

This method employs a user research platform based on the Internet. The participants and the researcher do not need to be in the same place at the same time to use this method. They could be anywhere in the world where an internet connection is available. The participants complete the tasks, and their interactions with the product are recorded and uploaded to a server. The researchers later on, in their own time, access the screen recordings of the interactions and interpret the feedback from the participants. This feedback may include face recording as well as verbal think-aloud comments.

##### How to Conduct an Unmoderated Usability Test

To successfully conduct unmoderated remote usability testing, the following preparation is required:

1. Define the usability testing objectives.

- What do stakeholders want to learn?

- How would the findings benefit the company?

- Is the research method appropriate for all the objectives?

- Are all stakeholders in agreement regarding the goal statements?

- Which of the objectives can be included in future rounds of usability testing?

2. Determine the participant profile

- Number of targeted profiles and personas

- Age group, gender, nationality, and income of the target audience

- Relevant behavioral attributes, such as what they do, like, and dislike

- Sample size: the number of participants in each profile

3. Screen and shortlist candidates

- Prepare a list of screener questions to help you select your candidates.

- Determine which answers should qualify or disqualify candidates for participation.

- Level of comfort in thinking aloud

- Include a question to assess feedback articulation ability.

- Collect contact information to distribute the usability test and reach out if necessary.

- Request that participants consent to participate and agree to be recorded.

- Request consent from participants to store their personal information, if any.

- Include the type of incentive, the amount, and the payment method.

4. Choose a platform for user research

Choose a remote usability testing platform based on the information you want to collect and the products that participants will be testing.

- Is the platform compatible with the research method you will conduct?

- Is the platform capable of attracting participants?

- Is the platform capable of testing test material?

- Does the platform support the devices that the test must be run on, such as a computer or a mobile device?

- Is the platform video-centric?

5. Gather test materials

Determine and decide what you want the participants to test with the following options:

- Wireframes

- Design prototypes

- If necessary, the participants may need to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

- The availability of test materials as a dependency must be included in the usability testing plan.

6. Create a list of tasks to be completed as well as a list of usability metrics.

- Make a list of the tasks that the participants would be responsible for. Create the tasks based on what users would accomplish with the product.

- Limit yourself to 5 or 7 tasks at a time.

- Each task must correspond to the study's objectives.

- Tasks must be clearly worded and unambiguous.

- Clearly defined success criteria.

- Each task must specify an end state so that participants know the task has been completed.

- The sequence in which tasks are to be presented is referred to as task flow.

- Determine usability metrics for each task.

7. Determine usability metrics for each task.

- Failure or success

- Time to complete the task

- Time to first click or tap

- Count of clicks and taps

- Count of swipes

- Paths of navigation, such as the number of pages or screens

- A task's number of retries

8. Plan questions to be asked after the tasks are finished

Survey questions can be asked at the end of any task and immediately after completion. Survey questions can be of various types:

- Unanswered questions

- Single or multiple choice

- Likert scale of 5 to 7 points

- Dropdown

- Matrix or ranking

- Inquire about recall, task difficulty, and any additional information relevant to providing background information about participants, such as other similar experiences they have had.

9. Perform a test run prior to the test launch.

- Experimenting with the test yourself, also known as a dry run, helps to refine it.

- Dry run with internal and external participants

- Determine whether or not there is a fatigue factor in completing the test.

- Check to see if everything is working as it should. For example, prototypes are loading correctly and are the correct ones.

- Fine-tune questions and include information that may have been overlooked.

- If everything is in order, start the test.
